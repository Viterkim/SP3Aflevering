Viktor SP3

1. We handled persistence by mapping things down to a database, by building our own entities, and then
programming mappers so we could map the entities to the DB. Esentially making boilerplate code.

2. Pros: Fast
Cons: Can produce bad programmers since you aren't really doing anything yourself.

3. Tries to make a consistant standard on how to make abstract objects into database objects.

4. By using specific @Inheritance tags above variables


Used inheritance strategy with each object getting their own table to give a better overview.


Had problems with summing in JPQLExc
